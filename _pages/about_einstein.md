Hi, Iâ€™m **Ahmad (Hamed) Hashemi**, a PhD candidate in Information Technology at Carleton University, Ottawa, supervised by Prof. Wei Shi. My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Federated Learning** with applications in **AI-generated text detection, writing style analysis, and wireless communications**.

I have developed and published multiple projects at the intersection of **AI and applied data science**:
- **AI-Generated Text Detection**: Building models to distinguish between human-written, AI-polished, and AI-generated content at document and sentence levels.
- **Federated Learning for NLP**: Designing privacy-preserving distributed learning approaches for text classification tasks across multiple clients.
- **Wireless Channel Estimation**: Exploring FL-based solutions for 5G Massive MIMO and RIS-aided systems.

Beyond research, I enjoy applying my skills to **practical ML and data science problems**. I have hands-on experience with **PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Python data pipelines, and visualization tools**. I also mentor students as a teaching assistant and collaborate with teams on interdisciplinary projects.

ðŸ“Œ Iâ€™m now preparing for the **next step of my career** as a **Data Scientist / ML Engineer**, where I aim to bring my expertise in **deep learning, NLP, and scalable AI systems** to real-world challenges.  

When Iâ€™m not coding or writing, you might find me exploring Ottawa on my e-bike, reading about AI ethics, or discovering new ways to connect research with industry applications.
